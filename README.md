- **`/docs/`** ‚Äì Project and data pipeline documentation
- **`/database/`** ‚Äì SQL schema (`supabase-schema.sql`) and migrations
- **`/data/`** ‚Äì Data workspace
  - `raw/` (gitignored) large imported or debug artifacts
  - `derived/` (gitignored) normalized/intermediate artifacts
  - `examples/` small sampled JSON files committed for reference/tests
- **`/scripts/`** ‚Äì Organized automation & utilities
  - `maintenance/` recurring hygiene & enrichment tasks
