# Data Cleanup & Enrichment - Pending / Follow-Up Items

(Autogenerated tracker â€“ keep unchecked until verified complete)

## In-Progress Core Task
- [x] Full global hygiene run initial apply pass executed (large batch). Need residual cleanup.
- [ ] Residual cleanup: 70 placeholders, 630 games missing key metadata (631 distinct BGG fetches)
- [ ] Run targeted apply for remaining workset once confirmed safe
 - [x] Dynamic award prefix scan & cleanup (all detected placeholders repaired, Zenobia included)
 - [x] 5 Seasons award placeholders (13 IDs) repaired (renamed & enriched)

## Post-Run Verification
- [ ] After residual pass: scan (dry run) should show near-zero placeholders (target < 5)
- [ ] Capture final metrics: total processed, renamed, patched, errors (if any)
- [ ] Count remaining games missing: summary, designer array, weight, image, year_published
- [ ] Generate audit list (placeholder_name -> restored_name mapping) for archive

## Missing / External References
- [ ] Re-run missing honor-referenced games script (print_missing_bgg_ids) after hygiene completion
- [ ] Insert any still-missing games (if list not empty) with proper metadata fetch

## Award-Specific Follow-Ups
- [ ] Confirm Charles S. Roberts (CSR) award entries no longer pollute Golden Geek views
- [ ] Evaluate need for dedicated CSR award segregation / dedicated page
- [ ] Review expanded AWARD_PREFIXES heuristic for false positives (ensure no real games flagged)

## Testing & Safeguards
- [ ] Add/verify unit test for inferHonorCategory (truncated category inference)
- [ ] Add tests for placeholder detection (AWARD_PREFIXES, pattern-based) to prevent regressions
- [ ] Add test ensuring import safeguard never overwrites real game name with honor title

## Schema / Data Integrity
- [ ] Verify Supabase schema column naming consistency (designer vs designers) and adjust scripts/docs
- [ ] Confirm weight values populated for newly enriched games (spot check a sample)
- [ ] Confirm summary generation populated where description exists and summary was null
- [ ] Ensure no residual placeholder artifacts (e.g., '(Winner)', '(Nominee)' dangling in names)

## Frontend Integration
- [ ] Ensure GameCard (and awards pages) display new metadata (designers, weight, summary) where available
- [ ] Add conditional UI for missing metadata (skeleton or icon) if desired

## Performance / Reliability
- [ ] Log analysis: review retry/backoff effectiveness (frequency of 429s vs successes)
- [ ] Consider persisting last-run stats to a JSON report for historical tracking

## Documentation
- [ ] Add README section detailing hygiene workflow & environment variables (BGG_CONCURRENCY, BGG_DELAY_MS)
- [ ] Document how to run residue vs full metadata enrichment scripts safely
- [ ] Add guidance on auditing renamed placeholder games

## Potential Enhancements (Deferred)
- [ ] Incremental nightly enrichment for newly added games only
- [ ] Cache layer for BGG fetches to reduce repeat calls
- [ ] Automated alert if placeholder count > threshold after any import
